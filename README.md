# 🎮 PRODIGY_SD_02 — Number Guessing Game with Python GUI

🎯 **Task 2: Number Guessing Game**  
This is my second task for the **Prodigy InfoTech Internship**. I built a number guessing game using Python where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it.

## 💻 What I Built

- **🖥 Console Version**:  
  A simple command-line version that gives feedback like **"Too high"** or **"Too low"** until the user guesses correctly.

- **🪟 GUI Version (with tkinter)**:  
  A more interactive version built using `tkinter`, featuring:
  - Input box for user guesses  
  - "Guess" and "Restart" buttons  
  - Live feedback display  
  - A clean and user-friendly interface

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Designing basic GUI applications using **`tkinter`**
- Handling user input and dynamically updating the UI
- Writing **clean, modular Python code**
- Managing projects using **GitHub** and **VS Code**
