Number Guessing Game with Python GUI using tkinter
ðŸŽ¯ Task 2: Number Guessing Game

This is my second task for the Prodigy Infotech internship. I built a Number Guessing Game in Python where the computer randomly picks a number, and the user has to guess it.

## ðŸ’» What I Built

- **Console version**: A simple CLI version that gives feedback like "Too high" or "Too low" until the user guesses correctly.
- **GUI version**: Used `tkinter` to make it more interactive. It has a clean interface with an input box, guess and restart buttons, and live feedback.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to use `tkinter` to design basic GUI applications  
- Handling user input and displaying feedback dynamically  
- Writing clean, modular Python code  
- Managing tasks using GitHub and VS Code  

Big thanks to **Prodigy Infotech** for creating this opportunityâ€”itâ€™s helping me apply what I know and push myself to keep learning.
